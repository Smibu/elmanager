# Elmanager changelog

## 13.8.2025
* SLE: Added Shape tool for creating custom shapes. (@SjurdurS)
* Improved error message for Steam Elma LGRs (they are not supported).

## 30.11.2024
* SLE: Line and vertex colors support transparency.
* SLE: Bugfix: Zoom fill was slightly wrong when checking for pictures and textures.
* SLE: Bugfix: LGR filename, pictures and textures were case sensitive.

## 16.11.2024
* SLE: Added a new polygon operation "Fix self-intersections".
* SLE: Improved toggle grass logic.
* SLE: Restored shortcuts of QuickGrass and Delete all grass.
* SLE: Bugfix: Picture drawing order was sometimes wrong for overlapping pictures with different clipping and same distance.
* SLE: Bugfix: Changed shortcut of vertical mouse lock from C to Z because C is shortcut for cut/connect tool.
* SLE: Bugfix: When opening SLE with a blank level, it crashed after saving.
* Replay viewer: Bugfix: Bike rotation was subtly wrong which caused small twitching after a 360-degree rotation.

## 31.7.2024
* SLE: LGR file box is a dropdown that lists LGRs in LGR directory. Publicly known LGRs are identified and this info is shown after filename.
* SLE: Pictures and textures are always loaded losslessly: if LGR is missing pictures or textures,
  the missing ones are shown as placeholders in editor instead of being deleted.
* SLE: External changes to lev file are noticed and any possible corruption is fixed automatically.
* SLE: Current zoom is shown and editable.
* SLE: Changing z-order ("Bring to front" / "Send to back") is supported for grass polygons.
* SLE: Added esc alias key to playing settings.
* SLE: Start object is supported in selection filter.
* SLE: Improved help text of vertex tool.
* SLE: Zoom textures is enabled by default because it is less buggy and looks better if grass is shown.
* SLE: Removed zoom tool for not being useful.

* Replay viewer: Players can be selected from the viewing area.
* In rendering settings, LGRFile is now LGROverride. If set, this LGR is always used instead of `<lgrdir>/<levellgr>.lgr`. The earlier setting was messy and not clear what it meant.
* SLE: Bugfix: Frame tool sometimes added the source polygon back when switching to another tool.

## 24.2.2023

### Replay viewer
* Bugs fixed.

## 11.11.2010

### Level editor
* Support for pictures and textures. LGR file must be specified to enable this.
* Improved context menu.
* Selection filter. Useful for example if you want to delete all textures/pictures from a level.
* Ability to start creating vertex from polygon edge too (earlier you had to click some vertex).
* Ability to have apples placed automatically when creating pipe (press Space to switch between modes). Adjust the other parameter with Ctrl + +/-.
* Combined Merge and Difference tools into one (press Space to switch the mode).
* Combined Apple, Killer and Flower modes into one (use Space here too for switching).

### Replay viewer
*  Use "zoom fill" by default.
*  Do not select any player by default.
*  Maximize the window of replay viewer by deafault (not fullscreen).

## 12.10.2010
### Replay viewer

* Fixed the small annoyances mentioned by Ali.

## 28.9.2010
### Replay viewer
* Changed the fullscreen shortcut key to F11 (because Enter interfered with things).

### Level editor
* Fixed small bug in Undo/Redo.

* AutoGrass thickness is adjustable in config window, as well as grid size.

## 20.9.2010
### Replay manager
* Improved "Save to textfile" -function performance A LOT.
* Improved replay list performance somewhat.

* Mirror level -function.
* Info about current selection is shown at the bottom.
* Filename suggestion according to the given pattern (regular expression).
* Set default level title, or use filename.
* Fixed the bug that was found by Ville_J: When I select to transform a polygon, press delete, then start transforming the empty area, another polygon disappears and the polygon I chose to transform comes up again.
* Other small tweaks (fixed tab order for tools and others...).

## 12.9.2010
* Improved AutoGrass.
* Move screen by clicking and holding middle mouse button (usually the wheel).

* Replay viewer is in separate window now. You can open as many new viewers as you want.

### Replay viewer
* Select colors for objects/active player/inactive player/ground/sky/driving lines for each player.
* Event list that shows events for currently selected player. Click some event in the list to go in that moment in viewer. You can filter different events with the six checkboxes.
* Zoom in/out with mouse wheel (in addition to left/right click).
* See multiple players' driving lines at the same time by highlighting many replays in the playlist. "Show driver path" must be checked of course. Driving lines aren't visible while playing.
* Playing is controlled now by a timer, which makes playing (hopefully) smoother.
* Current speed shown for currently selected player.
* Separate button for saving replay viewer settings. Note that for driving lines, only the color for 1st player's line is saved. This is mainly because there's no upper bound for the number of replays in the playlist.

## 8.7.2009

* Improved saving times to textfile -feature, and fixed a bug in it - it showed wrong total time if it was more than 1 hour.
* Replay and level folder selection are now in contextmenu (open it by right-clicking anywhere in the program, except replay viewer and replay list).

* Play many replays simultaneously. No limit. Level must be the same of course.
* Save times of selected replays to a textfile with 2 or 3 decimals. Total time is included in it.
* Calculate total time of selected replays automatically (with duplicate replay search too).
* Click in eventbox to go in that moment in replay viewer (if lev exists). Switch automatically to viewer if not already.
* Zoom in/out by clicking the level picture with mouse (left click=Zin, right click=Zout). The place you clicked will be the new center of the viewer. ZIn and ZOut buttons removed.
* "Advanced search options" -button with which you can search by number of left/right volts, turns, appletakes etc.
* Calculate trip for both players.
* "Lock viewer" -checkbox with which the replays on the playlist can stay there if you want to check another replay's properties. It must have the same level.

### Minor updates

* Removed ability to scroll level in viewer with arrow buttons, because it didn't always work, and you can easily use now mouse for that.
* Message "Across levels are not supported" appears if you try to play replays that have Across level.
* ...possibly some other small things that I forgot to put here.

### Bug fixes
* Sometimes the program went back to search options for no reason.
* When pressing zoom in/out after pressing pause, it didn't zoom right area.
* When deleting/removing replay from list while watching it, an exception occurred. Now you can't delete while watching.
* Improved the frame-drawing routines A LOT. Levels with lots of vertices play now much faster than before.

* Added Viewer size - box in which you can define the size of the viewer window. Range: 200 to 850, default=500.
* Added Loop delay - box with which you can make replay playing slower. This delay means milliseconds per frame. Range: 0 to 1000, but some 20-30 should give close to actual speed.
* Level and replay folder paths are hidden when switched to replay viewer (they may overlap it if the path is long).
* Added "Save picture as..."-button (saves what you see in replay viewer, format=png).
* Click twice Pause while playing=Stop (goes to start of the replay, in other words).
